    <h2>My first impressions:</h2>
    <!-- <p>
          I was very uncertain when I started the whole Trybe admission process one month ago. I did some research about them and decided to give it a shot. It was a long process. They have a code challenge, a couple of interviews, and some other paperwork steps. I got in and I was very happy about it, but I was also a little bit anxious about what I was going to find there.

          After 3 weeks, I revisited some concepts that I saw on my undergraduate degree. This time, however, I saw them in a completely different perspective. I was no longer learning just for learning, with no further purpose. I was learning for a reason, to apply in a company everything that I saw. And that, my friend, is something very very special if you are trying to get a job afterward. I am glad I found them, now I feel prepared to face my job applications.
