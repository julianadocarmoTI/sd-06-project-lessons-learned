        <h5>About what I learned</h5>
        <!-- requirement: more than 300 less then 600 chars-->
        <p>During the first two weeks I could recognize the value of some technical skills like bash and Shell Script and how to use them making the web developer job easier and faster. I already knew some of the commands, but never thought in using the way it was shown and it was quite impressive how it makes some tasks much faster. In addition of that the teamwork experience was very productive and thrilling.</p>

      <h6>What I expect to learn</h6>
      <!-- requirement: more than 100 less then 300 chars-->
      <p>At some time of those short two weeks, a friend that had no idea why GitHub was showing error messages. He was facing a hard time trying to explain what he did, after hours dragging on the troubleshooting by himself, but he shared his screen and in less than 5 min. his problem was solved. That’s just one example of how efficient it is to code and learn in group.</p>
